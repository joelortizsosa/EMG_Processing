Now you can start the software, first it's necessary launch the software of acquisition:

*Poppy_Force_Driver.m*

Then, you need to launch the software of learning:

*model_par_cibles.m*

Finally, you can start a control only with your EMG signals, like in this [video](https://vimeo.com/134840606), using this code:
